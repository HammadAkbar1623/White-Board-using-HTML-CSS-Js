# White-Board-using-HTML-CSS-Js
This is a white board I developed using HTML,CSS &amp; Js. You can draw shapes (rectangle, circle and triangle) Also you can draw the shapes only by stroke or by both stroke and fill. You can change the color or pick your own color. You can erase the drawing using Eraser. Click on the Clear Canvas button to clear the canvas and save button to save img.
